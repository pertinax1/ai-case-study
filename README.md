# TITLE
The Sales call center space is being disrupted by companies offering AI-enabled solutions.
## Overview and Origin
At my company, we are searching for a replacement for our sales call center application. After looking at several offerings I began to understand that choosing a call center solution that leverages AI will provide many advantages over non-AI enabled solutions.  While researching alternatives I contacted Five9 and met with their sales engineers to learn about their advanced features.   After 

* Name of company - Five9
* When was the company incorporated? 2001
* Who are the founders of the company? Mike Burkland and Todd Wilson
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Five9, Inc. was created to help businesses transform their contact centers into customer engagement centers.  
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Five9 is a publicly traded company.  In 2014, Five9 had an IPO of 10 million shares.  These shares sold for $7.00 per share, raising $80.5 million. (1)


## Business Activities

Five9 has optimized its contact center solutions for multiple industries.  These include Health Care, Financial Services, Retail, Education, Sales and Telemarketing, Customer Service, and Collections. (2)

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

     Five9’s goal is to provide a scalable cloud-based contact center solution that maximizes agent efficiency and effectiveness. 
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Their target customer is any call center whose business aligns with one of the vertical markets they target.  These include Health Care, Financial Services, Retail, Education, Sales and Telemarketing, Customer Service, and Collections.(3)


The following chart illustrates the projected market size for Contact Center Software.(4)

* What solution does this company offer that its competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

   Customizations for different industries increase the optimizations possible for their customers.  Their platform is also customizable so their customers can tune the Five9 solution to, more closely, meet their needs.

   While their competitors have many of the same features Five9’s combination of features and ease of use have allowed them to capture nearly 24% of their target market.   Their solution is highly rated in Gartner’s 2023 analysis of the contact center market placing them in the ‘magic quadrant’.  Companies in this ‘magic quadrant’ provide an excellent balance of features, price, and future capabilities in their product offering. (5,6)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

   Five9 leverages the following technologies.  What’s interesting here is many of the technologies are competitors.  For example, AWS, and Google Cloud services, IIS and Apache Web Server and PHP and .Net.  (7) 
 
  On the Five9 website, however, they simply say they use Google’s cloud platform.  Perhaps some of these other technologies are being used to provide integration with other systems such as Salesforce and ZenDesk.(8)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Call center/contact center phone and software business.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? (9)
   The leaders in this space have advanced their offering through the use of the following technologies
   1. Chat - Web and app based chat is used by customers to get their questions answered without the need to make a phone call to the call center.  Call center reps can handle multiple chat sessions simultaneiously which increases their efficiency.
   2. AI - This technology is being used to improve call routing, which helps the customer get the right person on the phone more quickly, reducing call wait times. AI also helps agents by listening to the call and suggesting responses that will help resolve the customers' questions.
   3. Integration - Call center software integrates with common CRM software.  This allows the call center software to tell the agent if the caller is a customer and can provide relevant customer details as soon as the call is answered.   Integration also allows customers to get help using the method of their choosing such as using a mobile app, phone call, website, text, and other channels.
* What are the other major companies in this field?
  There are many players in this space.  Other players that are also rated by Gartner as being in the magic quadrant are: Amazon Web Services, NICE, and Genesys

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  I'll answer this question in two ways.  First, I'll explain the expected benefit to my company if I purchase the Five9 product, and second, I'll talk about the benefits to Five9 for incorporating advanced technology into their product.

  If I choose to focus on a company that is impacting many companies I will list some of the benefits I believe I will achieve if I switch to Five9.

  1. Reduced agent training costs - Since the software can listen and suggest what should be said to the caller they won't be as heavily reliant on memorization.
  2. Higher close rates - The feature listed in #1 above will ensure that agents say the right thing at the right time which should result in higher close rates.
  3. Lower customer churn - Many of our customers cancel because the agent failed to set proper service expectations.  AI can be used not only to suggest what should be said but also to rate the call based on what was and wasn't said before the call ends.  If phrases that should have been said to set proper expectations were omitted the call will get a low rating and the manager will know they should listen to the call and provide feedback to the agent.
  4. Improved employee retention - The features listed above should help agents be more successful and earn higher commissions.  This should lead to higher job satisfaction and improved employee retention.

  Five9 has realized the following benefits to their business by adopting advanced technology.
  
  1. Five 9 has achieved a minimum increase of 15% and as much as a 40% increase in revenue in the last five years. (10)
  2. Five9 has nearly 24% market share in a very competitive space.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

  Market share and company rating are common metrics.  Five 9 has achieved a very high Gartner rating and has achieved a nearly 24% market share.  Both of these achievements indicate they are very successful.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
   Only three other companies whose are rating places them in Gartner’s 'magic quadrant'. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

  I would like to see contact centers adopt video calling.  Additional 'nonverbal' communication would improve customer service, improve clarity of communication, and make people feel better because they are talking to a person.  AI software could then be used to read facial expressions to further help gauge customer sentiment during calls.
  
  Dynamic User Interface tuning - I would like to see AI monitor agents use of the system and optimize the user interface to improve efficiency.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

   I believe that, eventually, contacting a business will be by video calling instead of voice only.  If Five9 pioneers, this technology it may help them retain or increase their market share.
   
   I have worked as a software developer and have developed software for call centers and customer service for over 20 years.  In my experience call center user interfaces are often cumbersome to learn and use.  Large systems that are created to meet the needs of many companies can't offer a tuned user interface that fits the way their customers use the system.  If Five9 could leverage AI to suggest changes to the UI after watching the agents work the product could become dramatically more efficient and easier to use for its customers.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  Screen recording and interpretation.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

I haven't seen any examples of call center software vendors that are already doing these things. These technologies would help Five9 differentiate their product and ensure they remain a leader in their market.
